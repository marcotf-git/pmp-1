# Popular Movies Application

This project is an exercise as part of the **Android Developer Nanodegree**, by **Udacity**. It allows users to discover the most popular movies playing. This is the stage 1 of the app.

The application queries an external database that has the most popular and top rated movies. It provides a grid arrangement of movie posters, and shows details of the movies when the user taps in that poster. ðŸŽ¥

The program uses:

a) **The Movie DB API** (<https://developers.themoviedb.org>) for querying `themoviedb.org` database, about the movie data.

b) **Picasso** library for handling image loading and caching (<http://square.github.io/picasso/).


# Installation

* Download the all the files and subdirectories and import the project in the **Android Studio**.

* Obtain an `API-key` from **The Movie DB** (<https://developers.themoviedb.org>) and set the value of `API_KEY` inside the `PopularMoviesPreferences` class. There is another more secure way for handling the `API-key`, storing it inside a new `gradle.properties` file, under the `.gradle` directory. The `git` will not add that file to the staging index. It will not be committed and pushed into a public repository, so protecting the key. See the instructions in the link <https://technobells.com/best-way-to-store-your-api-keys-for-your-android-studio-project-e4b5e8bb7d23>. (As always, first make an experience with a fake key, for confirming that it will not be in your public repository.)

* Turn on the developer mode of your **Android** phone or tablet, and connect to the **Android Studio** <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>.

* Configure the drivers of the `USB` port of your computer, so your **Android** device will be able to communicate with the computer. See orientations on the **Android Studio** sites <https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb.html>.

* In **Android Studio**, select to run your app. It will install the app in your connected device and starts it. See instructions on <https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html>.


# Common usage

Well, do you like movies?

**When the app loads**: When the app loads, it tries to load data (movie information), of the most popular movies, and shows the grid with the posters.

**Selecting 'popular' or 'top rated'**: In the menu, just select the `popular` or `top rated` options, and the app will reload the data with the choice.

**Viewing movie details**: Just tap on the movie poster! ðŸ˜®

That's it!


* This app is for learning purposes. ðŸ“š
